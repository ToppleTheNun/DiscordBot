As always documentating sucks so this will be pretty basic. We're available on the Discord for more info.

I assume you're familiar with the main project setup.

## Setup testing environment

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. notice it complain about token
4. Do this: https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token (name it something like "WoWAnalyzer DEV")
5. Copy .env.example into file named .env and add your Discord application token
6. Run `sudo yarn start`
